## Getting Started
### Requirements
WAMP Server or similar.
### Prerequisites 
The CreateDatabase.php script must be executed to create and initalise the myrentbuddy database with sample data. This file can be found in the "database" folder. 

## How to Use
To use the website, start the WAMP server and go to the localhost location of the repository in your browser. Execute the Login.php script which will display the login interface. 
There are two existing users which can be used: an admin user and a renter user. 

To login as the admin user, use the following details:
-	User ID: admin
-	Password: 123123

To login as the renter user, use the following details:
-	User ID: renter
-	Password: 123123

Alternatively, the Register.php script can also be accessed to create a new user. 
Once the login or register form has been submitted successfully, the user will be redirected to the main interface where the relevant functionalities can be accessed.
