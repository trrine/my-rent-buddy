### Prerequisites 
The CreateDatabase.php script must be executed to create and initalise the myrentbuddy database with sample data. This file can be found in the "database" folder. 

## How to Use
To use the website, the Login.php file should be executed which will display the login interface. 
There are two existing users which can be used: an admin user and a renter user. 

To login as the admin user, use the following details:
-	User ID: admin

Alternatively, the Register.php script can also be accessed to create a new user. 
Once the login or register form has been submitted successfully, the user will be redirected to the main interface where the relevant functionalities can be accessed.
